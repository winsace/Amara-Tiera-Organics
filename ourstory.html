                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded by Rhona Lynne Bansas in 2024, Amara Tiera Organics began as a humble dream in Davao City, Philippines. Rhona's journey started with a passion for organic skincare and a vision to create products that were not only effective but also gentle on the environment. What began as a small kitchen experiment quickly transformed into a thriving business.</p>

                <p>Our advocacy centers around supporting local farmers and promoting sustainable practices. We believe in the power of nature and the importance of sourcing ingredients responsibly. Each product we offer is made with love and care, ensuring that we benefit not only our customers but also the communities that provide us with raw materials.</p>

                <p>Looking to the future, we aim to expand our product line while maintaining our commitment to quality and sustainability. We plan to launch educational initiatives that raise awareness about the importance of organic ingredients and sustainable practices. Together with our community, we hope to inspire others to join us on this journey towards a healthier planet.</p>

                <p>As we continue to grow, our dedication to transparency and ethical sourcing will remain at the forefront of our mission. Join us as we make strides towards a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>
